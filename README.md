# * Mini Calculator Project

## Project Overview
This project is a fully functional command-line calculator developed as part of a Software Development assignment. The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate proficiency in:
* **Python Programming** (Logic and error handling)
* **Version Control** (Git commands and repository management)
* **Development Environment** (VS Code setup and workflow)


##  Key Features
* **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
* **Smart Error Handling:** Includes a specific check for `ZeroDivisionError` to prevent crashes when dividing by zero.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters valid numeric choices and numbers.
* **Modular Code:** Written using Python functions (`def`) for better readability and maintenance.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* teminal used : VS CODE TERMINAL
