# * Mini Calculator Project

## Project Overview
This project is a fully functional command-line calculator developed as part of a Software Development assignment. The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate proficiency in:
* **Python Programming** (Logic and error handling)
* **Version Control** (Git commands and repository management)
* **Development Environment** (VS Code setup and workflow)


##  Key Features
* **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
* **Smart Error Handling:** Includes a specific check for `ZeroDivisionError` to prevent crashes when dividing by zero.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters valid numeric choices and numbers.
* **Modular Code:** Written using Python functions (`def`) for better readability and maintenance.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* teminal used : VS CODE TERMINAL

##1. Project Initialization and Coding I started by setting up my local development environment using Visual Studio Code. I created a project folder named MiniCalculator and developed the core logic in a file named calculator.py. I used Python to implement four modular functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring to include error handling for division by zero. To ensure code readability, I added professional docstrings and comments.

##2. Local Version Control (Git) Once the code was stable, I utilized Git to manage my source code history locally.
I ran git init to initialize the repository.
I used git add . to stage my files.
I executed git commit -m "..." to create a permanent snapshot of my work.

##3. Repository Setup on GitHub I logged into my GitHub account and created a new public repository named mini-calculator. I ensured the repository was created without a default README to avoid merge conflicts during the initial upload.

##4. Linking and Deployment To host my project online, I connected my local VS Code environment to GitHub.
I used git remote add origin <URL> to link my local folder to the remote repository.
When I encountered an issue where an old remote link existed, I used git remote remove origin to clean the configuration before re-linking.

Finally, I deployed my code using git push -u origin main.

##5. Documentation In the final step, I created a README.md file. I documented the project features, installation steps, and included a screenshot of the application in action to ensure the project is user-friendly and meets professional standards.
